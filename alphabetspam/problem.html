About 90percent of the 300 billion emails sent every day are spam. Thus,
a fast spam detection mechanism is crucial for large email providers.
Lots of spammers try to circumvent spam detection by rewriting words
like “M0n3y”, “Ca$h”, or “Lo||ery”.

A very simple and fast spam detection mechanism is based on the ratios
between whitespace characters, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and
symbols. Symbols are defined as characters that do not fall in one of
the first three groups.


    Input

The input consists of:

  *

    one line with a string consisting of at least 1and at most
    100000characters.

A preprocessing step has already transformed all whitespace characters
to underscores (_), and the line will consist solely of characters with
ASCII codes between 33 and 126 (inclusive).


    Output

Output four lines, containing the ratios of whitespace characters,
lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and symbols (in that order). Your
answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most 10−6.
