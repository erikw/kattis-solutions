Fred works as an IT consultant in an insurance company. As they always
had a large amount of customers waiting and arguing at the front desk,
management decided to deploy a ticket machine. Each customer would get a
ticket with a number and there will be fancy LCD display over each desk
showing the number of the next person. Fred was appointed to get this
new enhancement working.

Because Fred is lazy when it comes to manual labor and as an IT
consultant he wouldn’t lower himself to the level of some hardware
technician (except when upgrading his own computer), he asked few
technicians to install the displays and prepared himself just to plug in
the ticket machine and try it out. Unfortunately (for Fred) the
technicians, either inspired by Mr.Bean or because of their
carelessness, installed the display upside-down.

Being a software guy, Fred decided that the hardware should not be
tampered with after it is installed (except for the case if he would be
able to get back the technicians to repair it, but they were already
angry at him for his nagging). Then he noted that from time to time the
display shows a correct number even when it is upside-down. And hey, the
ticket machine is an embedded device and contains a small processor! It
would be just a sin for an IT guy not to try to meddle with it and try
running an own version of Linux. Now we just need to figure out which
readable numbers will the display show.


    Task

In the beginning the display shows the number 1 on its display. Each
second the number shown is increased by 1. We see the display
upside-down and thus not everything we see will make sense. Your task is
to compute the K-th valid number we will see on the display. The digits
the display uses are shown on the images below. An upside-down 1 still
count as 1. The number we see may have leading zeroes – e.g. turning the
number 600 upside down leads to a valid number.

    Input

Input file will consist of several integers Ki, one per line. There will
be at most 1100 lines in the input.


    Output

For each Kifrom the input file, output the Ki-th number shown on the
display (including the leading zeroes, if there are some).
